# SwiftStack Universe

### Current progress
You can track the state of things [here](https://github.com/orgs/swift-stack/projects/1).

### Requirements

At the moment all the modules should work with Xcode 10 / Swift 4.2.<br>
You can also use our [docker image](https://github.com/swift-stack/docker).<br>

## What do we have

### Quick start

* [Starters](https://github.com/swift-stack/starters) - easy way to start new project
* [Examples](https://github.com/swift-stack/examples) - basic examples for our modules

### Concurrency

* [Async](https://github.com/swift-stack/async) - simple abstraction to switch between Fiber / Tarantool
* [Fiber](https://github.com/swift-stack/fiber) - cooperative multitasking with non-blocking asynchronous io written in Swift

We can't wait for Swift's async/await, but when it comes the API won't change much.

### IO

* [AIO](https://github.com/swift-stack/aio) - asynchronous io with synchronous api
* [Stream](https://github.com/swift-stack/stream) - io abstractions + basic streams, buffered stream, reader/writer

### Cryptography

* [Crypto](https://github.com/swift-stack/crypto) - digest, encryption, asn.1, uuid
* [TLS](https://github.com/swift-stack/tls) - TLS 1.2, 1.3

### Frontend

* [View](https://github.com/swift-stack/view) - component cross-platform view engine

### Backend

* [Web](https://github.com/swift-stack/web) - MVC, Controllers, DependencyInjector ([example](https://github.com/swift-stack/examples/tree/master/web))
* [HTTP](https://github.com/swift-stack/http) - high performance coders, server + client ([example](https://github.com/swift-stack/examples/tree/master/http))
* Nginx - load balancing, tls proxy and static files ([example](https://github.com/swift-stack/examples/tree/master/nginx-spa))

A pure Swift solution will be available after TLS module is ready.<br>

### Database

* [Storage](https://github.com/swift-stack/storage) - multipurpose data storage
* [Tarantool](https://github.com/swift-stack/tarantool) with [swift stored procedures](https://github.com/swift-stack/tarantool#tarantool-module) support ([example](https://github.com/swift-stack/examples/tree/master/tarantool))<br>

### Formats

* [Hex](https://github.com/swift-stack/hex) - optimized String <-> RawBuffer coding
* [JSON](https://github.com/swift-stack/json) - streaming json encoder/decoder
* [MessagePack](https://github.com/swift-stack/messagepack) - streaming messagepack reader/writer + encoder/decoder
* [XML](https://github.com/swift-stack/xml) - streaming xml encoder/decoder
* [XML-RPC](https://github.com/swift-stack/xml-rpc) - request / response codable models

### JavaScript

* [JavaScript](https://github.com/swift-stack/javascript) - embed JavaScript in your Swift application (V8, ChakraCore, JavaScriptCore)
* [Node](https://github.com/swift-stack/node) - embed node.js for server-side rendering ([example](https://github.com/swift-stack/examples/tree/master/web))

### Audio

* [Audio](https://github.com/swift-stack/audio) - low-level audio abstraction
* [Music](https://github.com/swift-stack/music) - notes, pitch detection

### Other

* [Process](https://github.com/swift-stack/process) - fiber-friendly process abstraction
* [Time](https://github.com/swift-stack/time) - high precision time, duration, interval
* [Test](https://github.com/swift-stack/test) - convenience shims
